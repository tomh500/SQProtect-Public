A Minecraft Spigot Plugin with fix Geyser bug

This Project Fix spigot 1.13- with geyser bug.Player couldn't send msg who dead in creative mode(like fall into void,killed by someone)

Bedrock Client thought that you couldn't die 'cause you was in creative mode,but spigot thought you dead(java version)

then the plugin fix this problem.When You fall into void,your mode will be changed if you y<40 and in creative mode,then you can die in survive mode

it changed normal /kill if you use /kill @a it will change all players gamemode into survival.Then you need input /minecraft:kill @a that you can kill others safely
